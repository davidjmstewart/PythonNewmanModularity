# PythonNewmanModularity
An example of implementing [Newman's modularity algorithm](https://www.pnas.org/content/103/23/8577) in Python 3, calculating the modularity score for Zachary's Karate Network.

**N.B.** The computed modularity score is 0.393. This is the correct modularity score *without* the extra optimisation step recommended in Newman's paper.  

# Running

This is a self contained example. Ensure you have `numpy` installed, and run with `python newman_example.py`
